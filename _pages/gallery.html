      At ICRPSET 2024, I had the privilege of presenting my thesis, "Electricity Demand Forecasting in The Northern Region of Bangladesh: A Deep Learning Approach." It was a rewarding experience, especially for someone passionate about research, as it offered a platform to showcase my work and connect with like-minded scholars.
