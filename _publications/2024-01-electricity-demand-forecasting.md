This study addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting electricity
demand in the Northern Region of Bangladesh, a task critical for optimizing power
generation. A deep learning approach combined CNN-GRU, DLSTM, and NBEATS
models, with predictions aggregated through a weighted average. The proposed
models demonstrated significantly lower mean absolute errors with most consumers
achieving accuracy above 98%, indicating their potential for providing more reliable
demand forecasts. These findings suggest that the adoption of these advanced models
could improve decision-making processes in electricity generation, leading to a more
efficient power grid.
