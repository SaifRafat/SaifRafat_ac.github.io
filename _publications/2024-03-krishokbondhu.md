In Bangladesh, many farmers continue to face challenges in accessing timely, expert-level agricultural guidance. This
paper presents KrishokBondhu, a voice-enabled, call-centre–
integrated advisory platform built on a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for Bengalispeaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural handbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications;
applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and documentparsing pipelines to digitize and structure the content; and
indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic
retrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can
call the system to receive real-time, context-aware advice: speechto-text converts the Bengali query, the RAG module retrieves
relevant content, a large language model (Gemma 3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers
the answer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation,
KrishokBondhu produced high-quality responses for 72.7% of
diverse agricultural queries covering crop management, disease
control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the KisanQRS
benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs.
3.13) on a 5-point scale—a 44.7% improvement—with especially
large gains in contextual richness (+367%) and completeness
(+100.4%), while maintaining comparable relevance and technical specificity. Semantic-similarity analysis further revealed a
strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality,
emphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses
in curated documentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating call-centre accessibility, multilingual voice
interaction, and modern RAG techniques to deliver expert-level
agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi farmers, paving the
way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory ecosystem.
