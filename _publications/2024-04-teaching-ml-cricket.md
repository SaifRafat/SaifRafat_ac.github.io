Teaching complex machine learning concepts such as reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Processes remains challenging
in engineering education. Students often struggle to connect abstract
mathematics to real-world applications. We present LearnML@Cricket,
a 12-week curriculum that uses cricket analytics to teach these concepts
through practical, hands-on examples. By mapping game scenarios directly to ML algorithms, students learn through doing rather than memorizing. Our curriculum includes coding laboratories, real datasets, and
immediate application to engineering problems. We propose an empirical study to measure whether this approach improves both understanding and practical implementation skills compared to traditional teaching
methods.
