The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and vast
tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing thousands
of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now, been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful general-purpose
vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted to this task
with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset—a digital
chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of Bangladesh’s
most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur Union,
Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially, this
dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements that
have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple color-channel
analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and then fine-tunes
SAM’s mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of riverbank erosion. The
resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this destructive process, achieving
a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a Dice score of 92.60%—a performance that significantly surpasses traditional methods and off-the-shelf deep
learning models. This work delivers three key contributions: the first annotated
dataset of disappeared settlements in Bangladesh due to river erosion a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this critical task and a method for quantifying
land loss with compelling visual evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which policymakers and disaster management agencies can
monitor erosion, anticipate its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable
communities in its path.
